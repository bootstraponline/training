To make it even easier to get started, I've uploaded a prebuilt version of the
iOS sample app. If for some reason this app doesn't work on your system, you may need to
build from source. Instructions for building the sample app from source are in the previous module.

After cloning the ruby_lib_ios git repository

> git clone git@github.com:appium/ruby_lib_ios.git

you'll find the UICatalog.app inside.
