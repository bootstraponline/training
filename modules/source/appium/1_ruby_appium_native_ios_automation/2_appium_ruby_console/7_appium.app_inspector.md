We've covered finding elements using the page command on the terminal.
Appium also has a GUI tool on OS X called Appium.app.

Appium.app enables visual exploration of the application to identify elements.
In addition, guestures are supported and can be exproted to working code.

By default Appium.app uses a bundled version of appium. If you're running the newest appium version from source,
then you can specify that in the preferences of Appium.app.

While most interactions can be done completely within the console, it's helpful to know there's an alternative.
In particular, identifying gesture values using only the console is difficult. Appium.app is great for that use case.
